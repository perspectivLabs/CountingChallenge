This script processes an image to detect and highlight objects using OpenCV and Matplotlib. It begins by reading an image from a specified file path and checks if the image is loaded correctly. The image is then converted to grayscale to simplify further processing. Gaussian Blur is applied to reduce noise, followed by binary thresholding to create a binary image. Morphological operations are performed to remove small noise, and edges are detected using the Canny edge detector. Contours are then found in the edge-detected image, and those with an area above a certain threshold are filtered out. Bounding boxes are drawn around the detected objects, and the total number of objects is annotated on the image. Finally, the processed image, with bounding boxes and annotations, is displayed using Matplotlib. This script effectively combines several image processing techniques to detect and count objects in an image.
