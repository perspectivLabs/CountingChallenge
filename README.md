# CountingChallenge

## Task definiton
* Count the number of items in the image and overlay masks for the same.

## Task list
1) Achieve the task definition using any Non-AI techniques (ex. OpenCV, etc)
2) Achieve the task definition using any AI techniques

## Overview
This repository provides two methods for detecting objects in images:

1. **Non-AI Approach**: Uses OpenCV for object detection.
2. **AI Approach**: Utilizes a model trained on a dataset, hosted on Roboflow, with inference done via the Roboflow API.
