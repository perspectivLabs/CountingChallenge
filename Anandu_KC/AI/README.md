# AI BASED COUNTING
This project demonstrates an AI-based counting system using the YOLO-World model. The YOLO-World Model introduces an advanced, real-time Ultralytics YOLOv8-based approach for Open-Vocabulary Detection tasks. This innovation enables the detection of any object within an image based on descriptive texts. Instead of finetuning, I have utilized the YOLO-World m model for this task.

## Features
- **Real-Time Detection:** Capable of detecting objects in real-time.
- **Open-Vocabulary Detection:** Allows detection of any object within an image based on descriptive texts.

## Installation

- Create a virtual environment: (recommended)

Linux/macOS:

```bash
  # Create a virtual environment
    python3 -m venv venv

  # Activate the virtual environment
    source venv/bin/activate
  
```

 Windows:

```powershell
  # Create a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv

  # Activate the virtual environment
    venv\Scripts\activate
  
```

- install required libraries

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Run the script:

```bash
  python3 predict.py
```
