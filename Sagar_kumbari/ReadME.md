## Task 1 : Counting and detecting using non-AI technique ##
The steps used in exeuting the project are as follows:
 * Read the image through opencv
 * Converting the image to grayscale
 * Blurring the image to reomove the noise in the image. Applying the best guassian blur on the image.
 * Convertingt the image to binary image. where pixels with intensity above 60 are set to 0 and and pixels below 60 are set to be 255 
 * The next step is the morphological opertions to clear the small holes in the binary image.
 * The next step is to find the contours in the binary image.
 * Filetring the countours based on the size.
 * Draw contours on original image and the count the contours.
## Task 2 : Counting and detecting based on AI techniques.
 The steps involved in detecting the items in a image and putting  bounding box using AI.
  * The first thing is to gather the data and then annotate the items in the image using a software called roboflow.
  * The annotation images are added to the dataset and then exported to the required format.
  * Since I decided to use YOLOv8 for the detection and counting i decided to export in YOLOV8 format.
  * Next step is to export the dataset and the start training it on YOLOv8 nano model because it's a small model and takes a very little time for training.
  * The next thing after training is to run a test image and count the number of boxes as it gives the number of items in the image.
  * After training the result of the test image are displayed.

## Both techniques yield a good results ensuring a great perfomance in terms of accuracy and the way the models works even when the trainng samples are very less. There are still lot of models that can be trained and they might yield a better result. The one i tried is with YOLOv8 and that performs pretty well. ##
