The dataset includes 23 images.
Screws are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)
* Auto-contrast via contrast stretching

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Randomly crop between 0 and 20 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -31 and +31 degrees
* Random shear of between -10° to +10° horizontally and -10° to +10° vertically
