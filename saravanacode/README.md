# CountingChallenge

TASK COMPLETED

AI TECHNIQUE

1.) I collected dataset for BOLT and SCREW
2.) Then trained it in yolo v8 object detction model
3.) Then inferenced the images in the model and got ouput as number of items 
4.) Also added bounding boxes to mask the dectected item


To see the inference images click this link


The ai technique brought upto 96% accuracy




NON AI TECHNIQUE


1.) I used opencv to read images and selected image proccesing to solve this problem
2.) I converted it to gray scale and applied blur to get contours  of the items
3.) Then adjusted threshold values of contours to get better view of the edges
4.) Then i got the perfect veiw of the Bolts and nuts and counted the contours 


The inference are on the notebook or u can also veiw the images in this link

This technique brought 95% accuracy
